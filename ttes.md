## üìà Key Analyses

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Data Cleaning for branch Table

**Goal:**  
Clean the `branch` table to fix missing/invalid values as per provided criteria.

**SQL Code:**
```sql
WITH cleaned_branch AS (
  SELECT
    id,
    CASE 
      WHEN location NOT IN ('EMEA', 'NA', 'LATAM', 'APAC') OR location IS NULL 
      THEN 'Unknown' ELSE location 
    END AS location,
    CASE 
      WHEN total_rooms BETWEEN 1 AND 400 THEN total_rooms 
      ELSE 100 
    END AS total_rooms,
    CASE 
      WHEN staff_count IS NOT NULL THEN staff_count 
      ELSE CASE 
        WHEN total_rooms BETWEEN 1 AND 400 THEN total_rooms * 1.5 
        ELSE 100 * 1.5 
      END 
    END AS staff_count,
    CASE 
      WHEN TRY_CAST(opening_date AS INTEGER) BETWEEN 2000 AND 2023 
      THEN CAST(opening_date AS INTEGER)
      ELSE 2023 
    END AS opening_date,
    CASE 
      WHEN target_guests IN ('Leisure', 'Business') THEN target_guests 
      ELSE 'Leisure' 
    END AS target_guests
  FROM branch
)
SELECT * FROM cleaned_branch;
```
### üß† Task 2: Response Time by Branch and Service

**Goal:**  
Determine if response time to customer requests varies by hotel branch and service type.

**SQL Code:**
```sql
SELECT
  service_id,
  branch_id,
  ROUND(AVG(time_taken), 2) AS avg_time_taken,
  ROUND(MAX(time_taken), 2) AS max_time_taken
FROM request
GROUP BY service_id, branch_id;

```
### üéØ Task 3: Targeting Meal and Laundry Services

**Goal:**  
Help management focus on improving Meal and Laundry services in EMEA and LATAM by identifying relevant service requests.

**SQL Code:**
```sql
SELECT
  s.description,
  b.id AS branch_id,
  b.location,
  r.request_id,
  r.rating
FROM request r
JOIN branch b ON r.branch_id = b.id
JOIN service s ON r.service_id = s.id
WHERE s.description IN ('Meal', 'Laundry')
  AND b.location IN ('EMEA', 'LATAM');

```
### üìâ Task 4: Identify Underperforming Services

**Goal:**  
Identify service-branch pairs with average customer ratings below 4.5.

**SQL Code:**
```sql
SELECT 
  service_id,
  branch_id,
  ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM request
GROUP BY service_id, branch_id
HAVING AVG(rating) < 4.5;

```
