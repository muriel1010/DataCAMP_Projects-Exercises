# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio—a curated collection of hands-on projects and exercises completed through DataCamp.

Within this repository, you’ll find multiple projects spanning data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and storytelling, each demonstrating practical applications of SQL, Python, and other key tools.

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes a detailed README that walks through the objectives, methodology, and insights gained.

Feel free to explore the projects and exercises to see how I approach real-world data challenges with analytical rigor and creativity.

💬 I’d love to hear your ideas, feedback, or any questions!
